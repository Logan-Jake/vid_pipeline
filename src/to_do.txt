Most needed.
- Make voiceover include story title
- update ffmpeg_pipeline to loop music if voiceover is longer (currently ends mid story)
- Improve graphic_gen as the trophies and other symbols are showing as blue squares


Nice to have
- get music_fetcher working to actually fetch music, this currenty fails to a local file
- get footage_fetcher working, as it currently defaults to a local file
