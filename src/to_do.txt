Most needed.
- Make subtitles not include title
- update ffmpeg_pipeline to loop music if voiceover is longer (currently ends mid story)


Nice to have
- get music_fetcher working to actually fetch music, this currenty fails to a local file
- get footage_fetcher working, as it currently defaults to a local file
